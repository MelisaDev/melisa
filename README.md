## About
<strong>MelisaPy</strong> is a Python library for the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). 

We are trying to make our library optimized. We are going to create really cool Cache configuration, so don't worry about the RAM :)



## Examples

### Start bot`s account

```python
import melisa

client = melisa.Client(token='your bot`s token', intents=melisa.Intents.all())

client.run()
```

<strong>You have to initiate your bot token in</strong> ``client`` variable

More examples you can see in <a href="https://github.com/MelisaDev/melisa/tree/master/examples">Examples folder</a>
